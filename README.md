# Jurassic Park Apex Predator App 

Crafted with Swift for iOS 17, this mobile application epitomizes modern development practices, guided by the MVC design pattern for optimal organization and maintainability. The project showcases a robust object-oriented approach, enhancing scalability and reliability.

At its core, the application excels in parsing JSON data through a sophisticated custom decoder, which translates complex datasets into an accessible and interactive data model. This technical prowess enables the app to offer advanced sorting capabilities, allowing users to navigate through the prehistoric era either alphabetically or by habitat (land, air, sea), enriching the educational experience.

A standout feature of the app is the integration of Apple's MapKit, which serves to pinpoint the geographical locations of dinosaurs with remarkable accuracy. This not only augments the user experience by providing a visual exploration of ancient landscapes but also embeds an educational layer to the application, offering insights into the historical distribution of these majestic creatures.
